Summer of Code Read Me 
============

This is a Git repository I made while learning NodeJs. The repository contains some practice programs that I made while doing JS, BootStrap and Node Js

You can use the given programs for your own practice. I highly doubt you'd be able to make some money out of it, but if you learn something do share your experiences. 

Cheers!
